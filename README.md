## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! I'm a junior full-stack developer on a journey to deepen my understanding of modern JavaScript frameworks and build practical, real-world applications. This space serves as a reflection of my learning process and growth in both front-end and back-end development.

Currently, I'm focused on technologies like React for building dynamic user interfaces, and Node.js for crafting scalable server-side logic. I'm particularly interested in understanding how to structure projects effectively, manage state in React applications, and handle API interactions cleanly. On the back-end, I'm learning about Express, RESTful API design, and working with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

Each project in this repository is a step forward in mastering full-stack development. Some are small experiments where I explore new tools or concepts, while others are larger, more complete applications meant to solve real-world problems. I aim to write clean, readable, and maintainable code, and Iâ€™m actively learning about best practices in areas like testing, error handling, and code structure.

As I grow as a developer, I plan to revisit and refactor older code, improve performance, and explore advanced topics like authentication, deployment, and containerization. My goal is to become confident building complete applications from scratch and collaborating with others in real-world environments.

Thank you for checking out my work! If you're also learning or have feedback, feel free to connect or open an issue. I'm always open to learning from the community and collaborating on cool ideas.
